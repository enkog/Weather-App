# Weather-App

> In this project I have used the API https://openweathermap.org/ for weather data. The current weather information is displayed for any city that we enter. Along with weather information, I'm fetching the coldest and warmest temperature for any city on search.

- I have used default Lagos as a default city for the first load.
- I have used Axios to work with asynchronous data.
- I have used luxon for a date and time conversion to display the current date and time.
- Enter the city name to get the weather information.
- Enter the city name to get the coldest and warmest temperature information of a city.
- Weather icons are also changing as per the condition of the weather and as per the day or night.
